# WiFi Nugget Cases
3D files for WiFi Nugget enclosures & cases!

## How to Print
The models are dimensionally accurate, but your filament may shrink!  We recommend printing the `FACEPLATE` and `ENCLOSURE` designs scaled at 101% in the X/Y dimensions.  `DPAD` can be printed at the normal size since button play is acceptable.

## Models
You can find the CAD files for the RubberNugget "GameBoy" design under the `Developer-Kit` folder.
